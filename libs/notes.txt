Note on how frames are referenced in the db:

Each detection ran frame represents the collection 
of non-detection ran frames before and after the frame
up till the previous and next detection ran frame

ex: detection ran frames = 0.png, 100.png then the detections
    for 0.png in the db will reference the frames from 0 to 100

ex: detection ran frames = 0.png , 100.png, 200.png then the detections
    for 100.png in the db will reference the frames from 0 to 200
